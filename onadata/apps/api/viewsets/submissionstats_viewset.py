    """
Provides submissions counts grouped by a specified field.
It accepts query parameters `group` and `name`. Default result
is grouped by `_submission_time`, hence you get submission counts per day.
If a date field is used as the group, the result will be grouped by day.

* *group* - field to group submission counts by
* *name* - name to be applied to the group on results

Example:

    GET /api/v1/stats/submissions/1?
    group=_submission_time&name=day_of_submission

Response::

    [
        {
            "count": 8,
            "day_of_submission": "2013-11-15",
