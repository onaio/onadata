Command apply_can_add_project_perms - applys can_add_project permission to all
users who have can_add_xform permission to a user/organization profile.

This was necessary because we previously (April 2018) did not have
can_add_project permission on the UserProfile and OrganizationProfile classes.
An attempt on doing this in migrations seems not to be a recommended approach.
