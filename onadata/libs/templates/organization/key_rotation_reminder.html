<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
  The managed key for organization {{organization_name}} is due for rotation on
  {{rotation_date}}.
</p>
<p>
  After rotation, all forms will immediately start using the new key for
  encryption.
</p>
<p>
  Forms will continue to receive and decrypt submissions encrypted with the
  previous key until {{grace_end_date}} after which old key will no longer be
  active and new submissions will not be decrypted.
</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The {{deployment_name}} Team</p>
